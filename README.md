The purpose of “Snack Conveyance System “ is  overcomes to the disadvantages of the traditional queueing system. Our proposed system is a medium to order online snacks hassle free from specfic  shops as well as mess service. The delivery-oriented system that allows clients to order from multiple shop at the same time. 

Creating an online snacks delivery system involves both frontend and backend development, utilizing technologies such as PHP, CSS, and a full-stack framework. Here's a brief description of how you can approach building this system:

Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
User Interface (UI):

Design a user-friendly interface for customers to browse snacks, view details, and place orders.
Implement responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure compatibility across devices.
Product Listings:

Display snack items with images, descriptions, prices, and an "Add to Cart" button.
Include filters and sorting options for easy navigation.
Shopping Cart:

Develop a shopping cart where users can review their selected snacks, update quantities, and remove items.
User Authentication:

Implement a user authentication system for customers to create accounts, log in, and track their order history.
Backend (PHP, MySQL):
Server-Side Logic:

Use PHP for server-side scripting to handle user requests, process orders, and interact with the database.
Database Management:

Design a MySQL database to store information about snacks, user accounts, and order details.
Create tables for users, snacks, orders, and order items.
Order Processing:

Develop functions to process orders, calculate totals, and update the database accordingly.
User Authentication and Authorization:

Secure user accounts with password hashing and implement sessions for authentication.
Apply authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own information.
Full Stack Framework (e.g., Laravel, Symfony):
Routing and MVC Architecture:

Use a full-stack framework like Laravel or Symfony to organize your code using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):

Utilize the framework's ORM capabilities to interact with the database using high-level objects.
Middleware:

Implement middleware for tasks such as authentication, authorization, and input validation.
RESTful API (Optional):

Create a RESTful API if you plan to develop a mobile app or allow third-party integrations.
Payment Integration:
Payment Gateway:

Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle online transactions securely.
Security Measures:

Implement SSL for secure data transfer and follow best practices for handling sensitive information.
Deployment:
Hosting:

Choose a web hosting service that supports PHP and MySQL.
Domain and SSL:

Register a domain name and configure SSL to ensure secure communication.
Testing:

Perform thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and security testing.
Scalability:

Consider scalability options for handling increased traffic and data over time.
By combining these frontend and backend components with a full-stack framework, you can create a robust online snacks delivery system that provides a seamless experience for users.
